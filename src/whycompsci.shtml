                    <p>As a person that is ending its third career year of Computer Science with the doubts rising about
                        Artificial Inteligence and a shortage in internships and junior opportunities compared to past
                        years still can be seen
                        many reasons as to why study Computer Science.
                    </p>

                    <h5>There are a few main reasons why students choose to study Computer Science.
                        First, technology envelopes our whole lives and many strive to contribute to
                        that technology. Second, Computer Science is an ever-growing field with boundless
                        opportunities still. Third, Computer Science education allows one to have a
                        global impact via the technology that can be created.
